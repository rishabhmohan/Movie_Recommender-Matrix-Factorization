# Movie_Recommender_System

This notebook recommends movies to a user based on user movie data. The algorithm used is matrix factorization using singular value decomposition (SVD). The loss was calculated using SGD.

2 methods were used:

1. Collaborative filtering: SVD matrix factorization
2. Recommendation using Pearson's correlation coefficient

Some great artcles to learn matrix factorization:
